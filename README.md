Extremely simple console application that takes the separate tilesheets from [DawnLike](https://opengameart.org/content/dawnlike-16x16-universal-rogue-like-tileset-v181?page=1 "DawnLike") and merges them into a single image, creating a custom atlas file in json format that can be used as a reference.

Might be extended to support other sources in the future (like oryx or Kennys).
